# School_District_Analysis
School district analysis using Python and Anaconda

## Overview of Project
  This project provides analysis for a a school district using Python in the Jupyter notebook. In this analysis we create data frames from CSV files and analyze schools' math and reading passing rates with analysis of several determinate factors. 

## School District Analysis  
This analysis takes school and student data, combines the separate data files into a combined data frame and analyzes percentage of passing reading and math scores.  First we do some data cleanup to remove prefixes and suffixes from the student names.  Then we extract student counts, calculate passing percentages based on testing scores and analyze based on school, grade level and budget levels.

## Refactoring based on faulty data from 1 school
After our initial analyis we discovered an issue with the 9th grade data from Thomas High School.  We performed additional analysis to remove the faulty test scores and recalculate our testing averages.
